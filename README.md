1.	For the first questions the solution is in the dedicated files of the project. 
a.	The configuration file contains two structs:
i.	The first provides bit map expected for each digit. The bit map is from the bits that should be "on" in binary representation, to the designated digit.
ii.	The second struct provides expected char that should be in each of the possible location of the 3x3 lines of characters that represents the 7 segment letter
2.	For the second question, both the original and the fixed class are in the project, along with comments and notes to explain the differences
3.	For the third question, the solution is inside the project, with all necessary classes and files.
4.	The data directory is used for input files, for the questions 1,3
5.	The output directory is for output files to be created, as well as original output files to compare the output to.
6.	The conf directory is for the configuration file, used in the first question
7.	Tests are inside the project, written as Junit tests.
